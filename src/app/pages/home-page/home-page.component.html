  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>
    I'm in the process of re-writing this website. So
    <span class="animate-pulse">don't panic!</span>
    I'll have things up and running again soon so Thanks for visiting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most likely, some URLS will have changed however since I'm planning on having a section for blog posts and articles instead of grouping everything together.
    (no need to have all my random ranting fill up the site content.)

<div class="prose-xl mb-12 min-w-full">
  <h2>Latest Thought</h2>
</div>

@defer {
  <app-content-list-item [item]="latestThought"></app-content-list-item>
} @placeholder (minimum 300ms) {
  <app-content-list-item [state]="ComponentState.Loading"></app-content-list-item>
}
