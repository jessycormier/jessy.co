I want to give 110% of myself to the work I do. It's not possible though, but tried anyways. I have gone through a lot of changes over the years pushing and pushing to find, something although I'm not sure what. I realize now there's more power in not giving 110% because you have more to offer over all. It's hard to remember this when you've spent a lifetime of pushing and it has had it's tolls. Healing and adapting is still possible, growing and learning is what we do. I find myself always on the balance of unconsciously looking for perfection in all things, in thought, in movement, in function, in solution, in resolve. In the end perfection is found in the non-perfect, the messy, the random, entropy. Perfect can be found in the math of existing and everything else in between is messy. I could go back and rewrite my thoughts here, just now but raw is better at times. It's not up to me for you to find meaning in my words its up to you to find it. Do you find my meaning or your own that again is up to you. Be proud of the excellence in the craft you do but don't push yourself to non existence because you'll die along with your craft. I carry this phrase in my mind as a reminder to just publish, just finish something anything, get to the next step, in all things life has to offer. It has more value when it's messy than when it's prim and proper.


*Perfect is the enemy of good* - Fran√ßois-Marie Arouet (Voltaire)
