I've been pushing a bunch of updates to the site. Mostly iterating over some of the designs and UX.

I've been finding inspiration from some sites, and video games. I've been feeling like a minimal style for awhile but it's harder than it looks to achieve. 

Something I'm working on during this process of building out features for the website is to just publish. I can always change something and iterate after the fact, having something out and done is better than never finished and sitting in my head. SO here you go, another "thought".

Right now, I've made "publishing" new updates and content to the site very painful. It's all manual. The idea is get systems up and running first and after focus on getting systems in place to make content publishing easier. The floating idea I have at the moment is to have some kind of process during build that will read the files I have (markdown files atm) and create the index's I'm managing automatically.

... and lastly, I don't like where the menu button is for desktop users. mobile it's fine, but yeah it'll need some work for desktop.
